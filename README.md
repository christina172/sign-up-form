# sign-up-form

The Odin Project Sing-Up Form project (Intermediate HTML and CSS Course, Forms)

My first project with a form. Input fields have additional attributes including placeholder, pattern, title, required, minlength and maxlength. The form uses built-in validation and JavaScript validation (for password input to see if passwords match).
